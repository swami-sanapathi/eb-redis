prepare 5 rules
each rule consists of at least 4 attributes, since we're building rule engine

usually the rules are looks like this
1. gender = 'Male' AND location = 'Tokyo' AND salary > 50000 AND (performance_rating > 1.0 OR annual_leave_balance > 15)
2. employee_type = 'Permanent' AND (location = 'Chicago' OR location = 'New York') AND experience > 5
3. (department = 'HR' OR department = 'Finance') AND project_completion_rate > 90 AND (performance_goal_completion > 70 OR direct_reports > 5)
4. (skills CONTAINS 'Python' OR skills CONTAINS 'Java') AND languages_spoken CONTAINS 'English' AND training_completed = true AND status = 'Active'
5. work_shift = 'Night' AND (location = 'Tokyo' OR location = 'London') AND (overtime_eligibility = true OR annual_leave_balance > 10)


2. employee_band = 'A2' AND (status = 'On Leave' OR status = 'On Probation') AND (overtime_eligibility = true OR annual_leave_balance > 10)
3. department = 'HR' AND years_since_last_promotion > 1 AND (project_completion_rate > 95 OR performance_goal_completion > 80) AND (education = "Bachelor's" OR certifications CONTAINS "PMP")
4. work_shift = 'Day' AND (employee_type = 'Permanent' OR employee_type = 'Contract') AND sick_leave_balance > 5 AND (training_completed = true OR professional_memberships CONTAINS "IEEE")
5. (project_allocations >= 5 AND direct_reports >= 2) OR (team_size >= 10 AND experience > 5) AND (skills CONTAINS "SQL" OR languages_spoken CONTAINS "English") AND (performance_rating > 1.5 OR bonus > 5002. employee_band = 'A2' AND (status = 'On Leave' OR status = 'On Probation') AND (overtime_eligibility = true OR annual_leave_balance > 10)
3. department = 'HR' AND years_since_last_promotion > 1 AND (project_completion_rate > 95 OR performance_goal_completion > 80) AND (education = "Bachelor's" OR certifications CONTAINS "PMP")
4. work_shift = 'Day' AND (employee_type = 'Permanent' OR employee_type = 'Contract') AND sick_leave_balance > 5 AND (training_completed = true OR professional_memberships CONTAINS "IEEE")
5. (project_allocations >= 5 AND direct_reports >= 2) OR (team_size >= 10 AND experience > 5) AND (skills CONTAINS "SQL" OR languages_spoken CONTAINS "English") AND (performance_rating > 1.5 OR bonus > 500


2. years_since_last_promotion > 2 AND employee_band = 'A2' AND project_completion_rate > 95 AND (performance_goal_completion > 75 OR direct_reports > 2)
3. department = 'HR' AND experience > 10 AND (skills CONTAINS 'SQL' OR skills CONTAINS 'Python') AND (languages_spoken CONTAINS 'German' OR languages_spoken CONTAINS 'English')
4. remote_work = true AND computer_serial_number IS NOT NULL AND email_quota > '30GB' AND (system_access_level = 'Admin' OR system_access_level = 'Manager')
5. (dob < '1990-12-31' OR (marital_status = 'Married' AND location = 'Chicago')) AND (benefits CONTAINS 'Health Insurance' OR insurance_coverage CONTAINS 'Gym Membership') AND (retirement_plan = '401k' OR payroll_type = 'Monthly') AND (professional_memberships IS EMPTY OR professional_memberships CONTAINS 'PMI')

what are the best way to build rule engine in performant and scalable way for NodeJS app, Each Rule Group had Multiple rules, number is not final, this group should be evaluated against the all the employees, here the employees number also not estimated
